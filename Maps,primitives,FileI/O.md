# Java Primitives versus Objects
notes taken from the above named article by:baeldung
## Java Type System
### Java has a two-fold type system consisting of primitives such as int, boolean and reference types such as Integer, Boolean. Every primitive type corresponds to a reference type.

### The Wrapper Classes are immutable.  Their state cannot change or be inherited from.

## Pros and Cons 
### The decision what object is to be used is based on what application performance we try to achieve.

## Single Item Memory Footprint
### Just for the reference, the primitive type variables have the following impact on the memory:

- boolean – 1 bit
- byte – 8 bits
- short, char – 16 bits
- int, float – 32 bits
- long, double – 64 bits

## Exceptions
### An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
## The Catch or Specify Requirement
### -  *Checked Exception* exceptional conditions that a well-written application should anticipate and recover from.
